/*
 * Name: "Unix-v7-ish_HelloWorld.c"
 * Description: Create the _Classic_ "Hello World." program, along with the Murry Hill v6 or v7ish supporting
 * Build framework (okay, a Makefile) so one can type
 *        $ make
 *        $ su
 *        # make install
 * in much the style that even dmr or kernighan, but not rob, might have done: I say "not rob" because I'm
 * using a visul editor and he most certainly would have only used ed(1), and if he saw me using vi(1), he
 * would have shaken me by the shoulders with zeal and shown me with great passion that there was not a single
 * editing task I could do that he could not also do in ed(1), and undoubtely with fewer keystrokes.
* This is a satirical story (duh), but while it's actually based on a real experience of a Bell L. CSRG
 * researcher whose name I convientely can't recall, I believe the only reason Rob comes off as abrasive
 * at times is simply because his mind works so faster than most other people that it must get frustrating.
 * Bottom line: we are all made better by having imaginative and uniquely creative minds like his, and people
 * who refuse to have their ideas held captive by the small minded cretinous "executives" of a propriety only
 * corp.  Dennis and Ken were a bit lucky, because for one, AT&T knows better than to try and order or constrain
 * their top Researchers -- They'll just flip the bird and walk to any place they want.  But money is the only
 * (fergive me) "Trump" card, and luckily no-one outside the Labs had either seen Unix, nor could have
 * predicted it's worth.  So Ken was able to take that tape to BSD and the entire system had only a simple
 * "Copyright Western Electric, AT&T" on it. SCORE.
 *
 * So even though out of the loop for 12 years, I was pleasantly surprised to find out Ken and Rob left
 * AT&T a few years ago to work at Google, and so already one of Rob and Kens creations, the Go(1)
 * language, is out the door.  I haven't even had time to learn it yet.  And I was really sad to learn
 * the soft spoken and truely Humble Dennis had passed away. But if you measure time not by seconds but by
 * joyful times and work that is your love and passion, I'd be lucky to live a fraction of what he lived.
 *
 * SHEESH.  Do I even *want* to write a ten line C program?  Why not a two line shell script:
 *

 *      #!/bin/sh
 *      cat $0
